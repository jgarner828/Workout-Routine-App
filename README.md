# Workout-Routine-App

Hello! This is my first attempt at creating an application. I'm a huge fitness enthusiast and have yet to find an app to track and monitor my progress, so I'm making my own. This project will be a work in progress.

Project Goal: Create a mobile friendly site that plans a workout program based on your needs and inputs.
