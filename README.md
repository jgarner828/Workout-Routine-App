Hello! This is my first attempt at creating an application. I'm a huge fitness enthusiast and have yet to find an app (that I like) to track and monitor my progress, so I'm making my own. This project will be a work in progress.

Project Goal: Create a mobile friendly site that plans a workout program based on your needs and inputs.

#Currently in development: 

Refactoring in progress for v2.0 of app. Need to figure out a more compelling name than what currently exists.
