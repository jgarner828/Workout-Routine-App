Hello! This is my first attempt at creating an application. I'm a huge fitness enthusiast and have yet to find an app that I like, so I'm making my own. This project will be a work in progress.

Project Goal: Create a mobile friendly app that plans a workout program based on your needs and inputs.

# Currently in development

Refactoring in progress for v2.0 of app. 

Need to figure out a more compelling name than what currently exists. 

Client side goals: Working on cleaner UI. Refactor using React with Redux for state management. 
Server side goals: Connect server with AWS cloud. Working on modularization of logic for easier version updates and maintainability. Check out dev branch!


# Future development

Allow for more ecomplex configuration for exercise progression.
